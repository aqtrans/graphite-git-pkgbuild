graphite-git
============

##A PKGBUILD for ArchLinux for Graphite, carbon, whisper built from git.

Primarily based on [mulander](https://github.com/mulander)'s updated graphite-web [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/mulander/graphite-web-aur), just with tweaks to build from the git version (since the last 'stable' Graphite release, last I checked, was back in January or so).  

I've also added a Phusion Passenger-compatible start script, so there's no need for additional webservers if you have a Passenger-enabled Nginx or Apache install.
